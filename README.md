# Game-Discovery-on-Cloud-AWS
The distributed App was made to pass the "Cloud Computing" exam for the computer science master's degree at "La Sapienza" - University of Rome.
This repository contains all the projects (microservices and GatewayAPI) implementations, DB scripts and also the Test implementation (Python_Locust) that was used directly to test the services on AWS.

More details about the architecture and deployment can be read on the report.pdf.

To be able to use the projects they must be downloaded separately.
